1. 	Grant of License 

Topshotter, Inc. ("Topshotter") grants you a nonexclusive, nontransferable license to use the enclosed program (the "Software") and its printed manual and other accompanying material ("Documentation") with equipment owned by you or under your control, according to the terms and conditions of this License Agreement. This License Agreement permits a single user to install and use the Software on only one computer at one location at any one time. However, if this Software is being licensed to you for use over a network (certain products only which are identified as Network versions), you may operate the Software as a multiple-user installation with either: 

(i) 	the maximum number of concurrent users being one (1) so that multiple individuals may access the Software, but that only one person at a time may do so, or 

(ii) 	 the maximum number of concurrent users being two (2) or more, in which case you must buy the first complete Software package and also a specified number of licenses for each additional concurrent user.

Educational & Student Versions: If this Software has been licensed and/or labeled as an Educational version, you may use it only for the purpose of training and instruction, and for no other purpose. If this Software is a Student version, it may be used only by the student who acquired it and only for study and instruction. Neither Educational nor Student versions of the Software may be used for commercial purposes.

Back-Up Copy: Regardless of which version of the Software you have acquired, this License permits you to make only one archival (back-up) copy of the Software. Such archival copy may not be installed on another computer, unless such computer is a partitioned drive of a server to which only the authorized user has access. In any event, the archival copy may not be used or installed as long as another copy of the Software is installed on any computer. If the Documentation is in printed form, it may not be copied. If the Documentation is in electronic form, you may print out one (1) copy, which may not be copied.

Additional Installation: You may install and use a second copy of the Software on the hard disk of a second computer you may have provided that (1) the additional copy is used only by you; (2) only one of the Software copies is in use at any one time at any one location; (3) the second copy of the Software is used exclusively with the copy protection device (if any) supplied with the Software. 

Upgrades: If this Software is labeled as an upgrade to software previously licensed to you, you must destroy all copies of the software previously licensed to you replaced by this Software, including any copies resident on your hard disk drive, and return the hardware lock, if any, which accompanied the software previously licensed to you (unless Topshotter explicitly notifies you that the hardware lock is to be used with the upgrade), within sixty days of acquiring this Software. Topshotter reserves the right to require you to show satisfactory proof that previous copies of the Software have been destroyed. If the hardware lock is not returned within the stipulated period, Topshotter reserves the right, without limitation, to charge you, and you shall pay, the difference in price between the upgrade license price and the suggested retail price of this Software. Software patches, if any, provided to you by Topshotter or an authorized third party in connection with the Software licensed to you hereunder, shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this License Agreement unless otherwise specified at the time of delivery.

Special UpgradeTerms for 3DStudio MAX and 3DStudio VIZ software. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may retain and need not destroy the copy of the earlier version of 3D Studio MAX or 3 D Studio VIZ previously licensed to you and may use this earlier version solely for the purposes of 1) backward file compatibility with the upgrade or update hereby licensed; or, 2) file compatibility necessary for licensee's customer requirements.  However, you may under no circumstances operate the new and old versions concurrently on different computers.


Lab Pack License. If the Software is licensed to you as a Lab Pack (certain products only) and you have paid the Lab Pack license fee, then you may install the Software on the number of computers and make the number of copies of the Documentation as authorized for such Lab Pack. In any event, no more than the number of copies of the Software authorized for such Lab Pack may be used simultaneously.
